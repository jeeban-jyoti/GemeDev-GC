Description :

In this game, players are placed inside a cube with four mazes on each wall. They must navigate through the maze on the ground floor to find the exit, all while avoiding being caught by an enemy.The exit is only on the ground floor and will be activated after 30 second. Players possess a unique ability to manipulate gravity, allowing them to traverse between the four maze walls using the 'j' and 'l' keys, right and left respectively. There is a cooldown period of 10 second before this power can be used again. The game ends either when the player successfully finds the exit or when the enemy catches them first.
